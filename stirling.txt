Alright, let’s carefully build up your understanding of **Stirling numbers** from scratch.
There are actually **two kinds** of Stirling numbers, and that’s where a lot of confusion comes from. Let’s go step by step.

---

# 1. Stirling Numbers of the **Second Kind** (Partition counts)

👉 Denoted by $S(n, k)$.
Meaning: **The number of ways to partition a set of $n$ elements into exactly $k$ non-empty unlabeled subsets.**

Example:

* $S(3,2) = 3$. Why? For set $\{1,2,3\}$, partitions into 2 parts are:

  * $\{1,2\}, \{3\}$
  * $\{1,3\}, \{2\}$
  * $\{2,3\}, \{1\}$

### Formula (Recurrence):

$$
S(n,k) = k \cdot S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)
$$

**Explanation of recurrence**:

* Put the $n$-th element into one of the existing $k$ subsets → $k \cdot S(n-1,k)$.
* Or start a new subset containing only the $n$-th element → $S(n-1,k-1)$.

### Explicit Formula:

$$
S(n,k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} (k-i)^n
$$

---

# 2. Stirling Numbers of the **First Kind** (Permutation cycle counts)

👉 Denoted by $c(n, k)$ or $\left[ {n \atop k} \right]$.
Meaning: **The number of permutations of $n$ elements with exactly $k$ disjoint cycles.**

Example:

* $c(3,1) = 2$. Permutations of $\{1,2,3\}$ with 1 cycle are the 3-cycles:

  * (1 2 3), (1 3 2).
* $c(3,2) = 3$. Permutations with 2 cycles:

  * (1)(2 3), (2)(1 3), (3)(1 2).

### Formula (Recurrence):

$$
c(n,k) = (n-1) \cdot c(n-1, k) + c(n-1, k-1)
$$

**Explanation**:

* Insert the new element into one of the existing $(n-1)$ cycles → $(n-1)\cdot c(n-1,k)$.
* Or start a new cycle with just this element → $c(n-1, k-1)$.

---

# 3. Relation to other combinatorics

* **Second kind → partitions** (connects to **Bell numbers**: $B_n = \sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)$).
* **First kind → cycles in permutations** (connects to **factorials**: $n! = \sum_{k=1}^n c(n,k)$).

There are also **signed Stirling numbers of the first kind**:

$$
s(n,k) = (-1)^{n-k} c(n,k)
$$

---

# 4. Quick Table

For intuition, here are the first few:

### Stirling numbers of the 2nd kind $S(n,k)$

| n\k | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | - | - | - | - |
| 1   | 1 |   |   |   |
| 2   | 1 | 1 |   |   |
| 3   | 1 | 3 | 1 |   |
| 4   | 1 | 7 | 6 | 1 |

### Stirling numbers of the 1st kind $c(n,k)$

| n\k | 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 |
| --- | - | -- | - | - |
| 1   | 1 |    |   |   |
| 2   | 1 | 1  |   |   |
| 3   | 2 | 3  | 1 |   |
| 4   | 6 | 11 | 6 | 1 |

---

# 5. Where they show up

* Counting partitions (second kind) → dynamic programming, probability, Bell numbers, distribution problems.
* Counting cycles (first kind) → analyzing permutations, polynomial expansions, random cycle structure.

---

✅ So the main difference:

* **Second kind**: "How many ways to split elements into unlabeled groups?"
* **First kind**: "How many permutations have exactly $k$ cycles?"

---

Do you want me to **show you some worked-out examples with the recurrence step by step** (like computing $S(5,3)$ and $c(5,2)$) so the mechanics are 100% clear?







Perfect! The **Möbius function** and **Möbius inversion** are core number theory tools — they look abstract at first, but once you see the mechanics and examples, they click. Let’s go step by step.

---

# 1. Möbius Function $\mu(n)$

The Möbius function is defined for integers $n \geq 1$:

$$
\mu(n) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n=1 \\
0 & \text{if } n \text{ is divisible by a square prime (like } p^2 \mid n \text{)} \\
(-1)^k & \text{if } n \text{ is a product of } k \text{ distinct primes}
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Examples:

* $\mu(1) = 1$
* $\mu(2) = -1$ (one prime factor)
* $\mu(3) = -1$ (one prime factor)
* $\mu(6) = +1$ (two distinct primes $2\cdot 3$)
* $\mu(12) = 0$ (since $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$ has a square factor)

---

# 2. Why is Möbius function important?

It comes from the **Inclusion–Exclusion principle** at the number theory level.
It lets us “invert” divisor sums.

There’s a key identity:

$$
\sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n=1 \\
0 & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

This is the arithmetic form of inclusion–exclusion.

---

# 3. Möbius Inversion Formula

Suppose you have **two functions on positive integers** $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ related by:

$$
g(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d) \quad \text{(Dirichlet convolution with 1)}
$$

That is, $g(n)$ is the sum of $f(d)$ over all divisors $d$ of $n$.

Then Möbius inversion says:

$$
f(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \, g\!\left(\tfrac{n}{d}\right)
$$

This allows you to “invert” divisor-sums.

---

### Example 1: Euler’s Totient $\varphi(n)$

It’s known:

$$
n = \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d)
$$

Apply Möbius inversion:

$$
\varphi(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \cdot \frac{n}{d}
$$

This is a standard formula for totients.

---

### Example 2: Coprime Pairs Count

Let:

* $f(n)$ = number of integers $\leq N$ that are \*\*exactly divisible by $n$}.
* $g(n)$ = number of integers $\leq N$ that are divisible by $n$.

Clearly:

$$
g(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d)
$$

So by Möbius inversion:

$$
f(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) g\!\left(\tfrac{n}{d}\right)
$$

This formula is often used in competitive programming for counting gcd-related things.

---

# 4. Connection with Dirichlet Convolution

In number theory we define convolution:

$$
(f * g)(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d) g\!\left(\tfrac{n}{d}\right)
$$

Key facts:

* $1(n) = 1$ for all $n$.
* Möbius $\mu$ is the **inverse of 1** under convolution.
  So:

$$
(f * 1)(n) = g(n) \quad \iff \quad f(n) = (g * \mu)(n)
$$

That’s the algebraic heart of Möbius inversion.

---

# 5. Practical Uses in CP

* Counting **coprime pairs**:
  $\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m [\gcd(i,j)=1]$
  solved using Möbius function.
* Multiplicative function formulas (Euler’s totient, Jordan’s totient).
* Polynomial / subset inversions (generalized Möbius inversion on lattices, like subset DP).
* Problems that involve “exactly k” vs “at least k” style divisor counts.

---

# 6. Generalized Möbius Inversion (Sets/Subsets)

There’s also a **combinatorial version**:
If

$$
g(S) = \sum_{T \subseteq S} f(T)
$$

then

$$
f(S) = \sum_{T \subseteq S} (-1)^{|S|-|T|} g(T)
$$

This is the **subset Möbius inversion**, which is the foundation of SOS DP (Sum Over Subsets DP).

---

# 7. Summary

* **Möbius function $\mu(n)$:** encodes squarefreeness and parity of prime factors.
* **Key identity:** $\sum_{d\mid n} \mu(d) = [n=1]$.
* **Möbius inversion:** lets you invert divisor sums $g(n) = \sum_{d\mid n} f(d)$.
* **Applications:** totient formula, coprime counting, gcd-based DP, multiplicative functions, subset sums.

---

👉 Would you like me to now **work through a concrete coding example** (like “count coprime pairs in $[1,n]$” or “compute totient for all numbers up to $N$ using Möbius inversion”) so you see how to apply it in practice?









Excellent, you found **stoyan\_malinin’s blog** about *“DP in Number Theory”*.
This blog is basically about a **dynamic programming reinterpretation of Möbius inversion / inclusion-exclusion** — a very practical way to count things like gcd/lcm pair statistics. Let’s unpack it carefully.

---

## 1. The Core Problem

> “Find the number of coprime pairs of integers from 1 to n.”

That is: count pairs $(x,y)$ with $1 \le x < y \le n$ and $\gcd(x,y)=1$.

---

## 2. First Observation

If $\gcd(x,y) = d$, then **both numbers must be divisible by $d$**.
So, we can first count all pairs where both numbers are divisible by $d$:

$$
\text{pairs divisible by } d = \binom{\lfloor n/d \rfloor}{2} = \frac{\lfloor n/d \rfloor(\lfloor n/d \rfloor-1)}{2}
$$

Let’s call this value:

$$
dp[d] = \binom{\lfloor n/d \rfloor}{2}
$$

---

## 3. What does $dp[d]$ represent?

It counts all pairs whose gcd is a **multiple of $d$**.

* Example: $dp[2]$ counts pairs with gcd $2, 4, 6, …$.
* Example: $dp[3]$ counts pairs with gcd $3, 6, 9, …$.
  So it **overcounts** if we want “gcd exactly $d$”.

---

## 4. Fixing Overcounting (Exclusion Step)

We want to transform $dp[d]$ into the **exact number of pairs with gcd = $d$**.

Notice:

* $dp[n]$ is already exact (since gcd can’t be bigger than $n$).
* More generally:

  $$
  \text{exact}[d] = dp[d] - \sum_{k=2d}^{n} \text{exact}[k]
  $$

This is the same as inclusion–exclusion:

* Subtract off pairs where gcd is $2d, 3d, \dots$.
* After subtraction, only gcd = $d$ pairs remain.

That’s why the algorithm iterates **downward** from $d=n \to 1$:
when we process $d$, the higher multiples are already correct.

---

## 5. The Algorithm

1. Precompute initial array:

   $$
   dp[d] = \binom{\lfloor n/d \rfloor}{2}
   $$
2. Iterate $d$ from $n$ down to $1$.
   For each multiple $k=2d,3d,\dots$:

   $$
   dp[d] \mathrel{-}= dp[k]
   $$

   After this, $dp[d]$ becomes the **exact number of pairs with gcd = $d$**.

At the end:

* $dp[1]$ = number of coprime pairs (since gcd=1).
* More generally, $dp[d]$ = number of pairs with gcd = $d$.

---

## 6. Relation to Möbius Inversion

This is literally Möbius inversion in disguise.
Recall: If

$$
g(d) = \sum_{k: d \mid k} f(k),
$$

then

$$
f(d) = \sum_{k: d \mid k} \mu(k/d) g(k).
$$

Here:

* $dp[d]$ before correction = “all pairs divisible by $d$” = sum of exact gcd counts for multiples of $d$.
* The correction step subtracting multiples is exactly Möbius inversion.

So this **“DP trick” = Möbius inversion, implemented bottom-up.**

---

## 7. Extensions (Examples from blog)

* **Example 1: gcd=1 pairs**
  → just output $dp[1]$.

* **Example 2: sum of lcm’s**
  If gcd is $d$, then the pair is $d \cdot (a,b)$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$.
  Use the same idea but instead of counting pairs, add contribution:

  $$
  \text{lcm}(x,y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\gcd(x,y)}.
  $$

  You can compute by grouping on gcd.

* **Example 3 (other tasks)**
  Similar style: count by gcd class, then subtract multiples.

---

## 8. Why It’s Called “DP in Number Theory”

* You’re not writing a combinatorial formula, you’re doing **array DP over divisors**.
* Transition: correct $dp[d]$ using results from multiples.
* It’s equivalent to Möbius inversion, but feels algorithmic and simple.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Compute raw counts over multiples ($dp[d]$).
* Iterate downward, subtract multiples to isolate exact gcd.
* This is inclusion–exclusion / Möbius inversion in disguise.
* General trick: *Count with gcd $\geq d$, then fix to gcd $=d$.*

---

Do you want me to **take the coprime pairs problem** and show you a **concrete worked example for $n=6$** with all the $dp[d]$ values before/after correction, so you can see the numbers cancel out step by step?
